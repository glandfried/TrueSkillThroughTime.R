\usage{
Player(prior = Nms, beta = BETA, gamma = GAMMA)

\S4method{performance}{Player}(a)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior}{A Gaussian object, the prior belief distribution of the skills. The 
default value is: \code{Nms = Gaussian(mu = 0, sigma = 6)}.}

\item{beta}{A number, the standard deviation of the performance. The default 
value is: \code{BETA = 1}. The parameter \code{beta} acts as the scale of the 
estimates. A real difference of one \code{beta} between two skills is equivalent 
to 76\% probability of winning.}

\item{gamma}{A number, the amount of uncertainty (standar deviation) added to 
the estimates at each time step. The default value is: \code{GAMMA = 0.03}.}

N@sigma == sqrt(p@prior@sigma^2 + p@beta^2)
